You can assign user roles to either new or existing members.

## Assign user roles to new members

To assign user roles while inviting new members:

1. Click your profile icon (a grey circle with your initial) in the lower left of [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Navigate to **Organization** > **Members**.
3. Click **Invite Members**.
4. In the **Invite Members** dialog:
   - Enter the new member's email address
   - Enter their name
   - Select the appropriate **User Roles** for the new member
5. Click **Submit** to send the invitation.

This method allows you to set permissions for new members before they join your organization. The invited member will receive an email with an activation link to complete the process.

## Assign user roles to existing members

To assign user roles to existing members:

1. Click your profile icon (a grey circle with your initial) in the lower left of [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Navigate to **Organization** > **Members**.
3. Locate the member you want to modify and click the **Modify User Role** <img src="/en/images/common/icon_edit.svg" className="icon" alt="Icon showing the Modify User Role button"/> icon in the Actions column.
4. In the **Modify User Role** dialog, select the appropriate **User Roles** from the menu.

This process allows you to update permissions for existing members as your organization's needs evolve.
